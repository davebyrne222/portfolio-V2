                    I'm Dave, from Dublin, Ireland. I've been working in the area of
                    software engineering for over 10 years and developing on the side for
                    even longer. After many years of longing to work as a dedicated software
                    engineer, I'm making the change. Please see the FAQ below for a more in-depth answer
                    as to why I want to make this change.
                </p>

                <p>Outside of software, I can usually be found playing board or card games with friends,
                    riding my motorcycle, or <nobr>(re-)watching</nobr> 80s & 90s films.</p>

                        <h3>Why Change to Software Engineering?</h3>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>
                    </header>
                    <div class="about-collapse hidden">
                        <p>There are three primary reasons:</p>

                        <p>I have always enjoyed software engineering - as an undergrad, I
                            studied C and C++ and caught the <q>bug</q>. As a post-grad, I began using python and since
                            then,
                            continue to use it wherever I can, be it work or personal
                            projects. As a scrum master, I was always interested in what the
                            engineers were doing, often taking the time to understand their work more
                            and at times, contributing.</p>

                        <p>I miss working on technical challenges - as a physicist, I enjoyed
                            working on difficult problems and creating solutions (often using
                            python).</p>

                        <p>The time is right - following suit with the recent widespread
                            redundancies / layoffs in the tech. industry in Ireland, my role has
                            been made redundant with my most recent employer. And
                            coincidentally, I had recently started studying computer science in
                            Dublin Business School as a hobby, so I felt it was the right time
                            to make the change.</p>

                            Physicists regularly use programming as a tool to assist in their
                            research and work, so-much-so that my first coding experience was as an
                            undergraduate student studying Matlab, C, and C++ for
                            numerical analysis. As a masters student, I used python for data
                            analysis and modelling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a scrum master, I spent 10 years working very closely with a number
                            of engineering teams across a broad range of projects including
                            industrial automation & IoT, speech technology for education, and most
                            recently in the travel industry connecting travel agents, airlines,
                            hotels, etc. During this time, I became intimately involved in the
                            development lifecycle, from requirements generation to design, from
                            prototyping to full CI/CD pipelined implementations, from dark-releases
                            to global customer releases (and the inevitable outages).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And during that time, I contributed to some software projects directly
                            and built some proprietary applications myself.

                        <p>
                            After finishing college, I began working in the pharmaceutical industry
                            as a Technical Development Specialist designing and building industrial
                            sensors that could monitor the quality of pharmaceutical product being
                            produced using just light. The company I worked for was small and so as
                            somebody who had some coding experience, I began to work with the
                            engineers, mainly providing technical expertise for the hardware
                            control software they were developing for the sensors I was responsible
                            for. Overtime, as the company evolved, I became the project manager for
                            the development teams, managing all in-house development projects
                            (essentially acting as the PM, PO, Designer, Tester etc.).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While there, I continued to use python to conduct data analysis and
                            later personally developed two customer-facing applications. The first
                            was an automation system developed in python that could be used to
                            control pharmaceutical processes via python scripts and websockets. The
                            second was a desktop application written in PyQT and R that could
                            analyse chemometric data and build predictive models using Partial-Least
                            Squares Regression modelling. These predictive models could be used to
                            monitor the product quality within an active pharmaceutical manufacturing
                            process and in turn, be fed back into the automation system I developed
                            so that the process could be directed to produce the highest quality product.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As time passed and the company evolved to a scale where it became
                            impossible to maintain multiple concurrent roles, I decided to focus on
                            being a scrum master, eventually moving on to other companies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having enjoyed being a scrum master for a long time, I miss working
                            hands-on developing software and so have decided to re-focus my career.
