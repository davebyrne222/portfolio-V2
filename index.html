                    I'm Dave, from Dublin, Ireland. I've been working in the area of
                    software development for over 10 years and programming on the side for
                    longer than that. After many years of longing to work in software
                    development, I'm making the change.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Change to Software Development?</h3>
                <p>Three reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I have always enjoyed software development - as an undergrad, I
                        studied C and C++ and caught the 'bug'. I then moved to python and
                        continued to use it wherever I could, be it work or personal
                        projects. As a scrum master, I was always interested in what the
                        developers were doing, often wanting to understand more of what they
                        were working on and at times, contributing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I miss working on technical challenges - as a physicist, I enjoyed
                        working on difficult problems and creating solutions (often using
                        python)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The time is right - following suit with the recent widespread
                        redundancies / layoffs in the tech. industry in Ireland, my role has
                        been made redundant with my most recent employer. And
                        coincidentally, I had recently started studying computer science in
                        Dublin Business School as a hobby, so I felt it was the right time
                        to make the change
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How are physics, Scrum Mastering, and Software Development related?</h3>
                <p>
                    Physicists regularly use programming as a tool to assist in their
                    research and work, so-much-so that my first coding experience was as an
                    undergraduate student first studying Matlab, and then C & C++ for
                    numerical analysis. As a masters student, I then used python for data
                    analysis and modelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a scrum master, I spent 10 years working very closely with a number
                    of development teams across a broad range of projects including
                    industrial automation & IoT, speech technology for education, and most
                    recently in the travel industry connecting travel agents, airlines,
                    hotels, etc. During this time, I became intimately involved in the
                    development lifecycle, from requirements generation to design, from
                    prototyping to full CI/CD pipelined implementations, from dark-releases
                    to global customer releases (and the inevitable outages).
                </p>
                <p>
                    And during that time, I contributed to some software projects directly
                    and built some proprietary applications myself.
                </p>

                <h3>How did I get here?</h3>
                <p>
                    After finishing college, I began working in the pharmaceutical industry
                    as a Technical Development Specialist designing and building industrial
                    sensors that could monitor the quality of pharmaceutical product being
                    produced using just light. The company I worked for was small and so as
                    somebody who had some coding experience, I began to work with the
                    developers, mainly providing some technical expertise for the hardware
                    control software they were developing for the sensors I was responsible
                    for. Overtime, as the company evolved, I became the project manager for
                    the development teams, managing all in-house development projects
                    (essentially acting as the PM, PO, Designer, Tester etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While there, I again used python to conduct data analysis and I also
                    later personally developed two customer-facing applications. The first
                    was an automation system developed in python that could be used to
                    control pharmaceutical processes via python scripts and websockets. The
                    second was a desktop application written in PyQT and R that could
                    analyse chemometric data and build predictive models using Partial-Least
                    Squares Regression modelling. These predictive models could be used to
                    monitor the product quality of an active pharmaceutical process which in
                    turn would be fed back into the automation system I developed so that
                    the process could be directed to produce the highest quality product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As time progressed and the company evolved to a scale where it became
                    impossible to maintain multiple concurrent roles, I decided to focus on
                    being a scrum master, eventually moving on to other companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having enjoyed being a scrum master for a long time, I miss working
                    hands-on developing software and so have decided to re-focus my career.
